# nmap-with-python
a script to vector nmap scans and place them into a single text file

please ensure when entering the network range it is in cider notation i.e. 192.168.1.0/24.

also this assumes that nmap is installed, I use it on kali linux when doing discovery scans.

This brought the standard time from 3 hours down signafically, bearing in mind that the excat amount of time depends on how many devices are up.
