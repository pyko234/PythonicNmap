# nmap-with-python
a script to vector nmap scans and place them into a single text file

please ensure when entering the network range it is in cider notation i.e. 192.168.1.0/24.

also this assumes that nmap is installed, I use it on kali linux when doing discovery scans.

This brought the standard time from 3 hours down signafically, bearing in mind that the excat amount of time depends on how many devices are up.

This will also parse the output of the detailed scans and put them into a csv.
